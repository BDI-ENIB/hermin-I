--- THE PROJECT IS STILL IN ALPHA VERSION ---

### Welcome to the DolMen program ###

Designed for the space domain, the DolMen project is much more than a simple interface, it is a
complete and modular tool allowing to follow an experimental rocket from its takeoff to its
recovery, to generate detailed reports of each flight, or even to simulate the data of a launch
from an external data frame.
As ergonomic as it is simple to use, it adapts to any rocket configuration, whatever the number
and nature of the sensors, and whatever the mode of communication with the ground.

The DolMen team.
